    <h1>Hello<em>.</em></h1>

    <h2>Welcome<em>.</em></h2>

    <h3>I'm Saar Drimer and this is my homepage<em>.</em></h3>

    <p>
      I'm an <em>engineer</em> with an appreciation for <em>design</em>, art,
      culture, and how they're all combined into the things that I and others
      create. My greatest <em>fear</em> is to bore myself or be considered
      <em>boring</em> by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mostly <em>create</em> through
      <a href="https://boldport.com">Boldport</a>, my company. Examples of my
      work are <a href="https://boldport.com/shop">here</a>, and some of it can
      be purchased
      <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/boldport">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saardrimer/">LinkedIn</a> has the dry
      facts about my career so far; I kind-of look good on paper. I'm available
      for &mdash; and interested in! &mdash; <em>contracting</em> work and
      <em>commissions</em>. Please get in touch so we can discuss how I may be
      able to help.
    </p>

    <p>Here's some more about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For three years I ran a service called <em>Boldport Club</em> where I
        sent unique <em>electronics</em> soldering projects that I designed
        every month to over 500 people all over the world. The Club
        <em>community</em> is marvellous and lives on
        <a href="https://discord.gg/hZhdtEh">Discord</a>. You can always find me
        there.
      </li>
      <li>
        I created <a href="https://pcbmode.com">PCBmodE</a> to allow me to
        realise my desire to combine <em>circuit-boards</em>, art, and coding.
        It's open source software written in Python and I'd love to continue
        developing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a few years I was an <em>academic</em>, working on hardware and
        banking <em>security</em>. Stuff from those days is
        <a href="/sd410">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm a compulsive doodler, not a morning person, and I really enjoy
        <em>cooking</em>.
      </li>
      <li>My name means <em>storm</em> in Hebrew.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you'd like to informally support my <em>work</em> you could
      <a href="https://ko-fi.com/saardrimer">buy me coffee</a> or
      <em>email</em> me &mdash; saardrimer@gmail.com or saar@boldport.com
      &mdash; with words.
    </p>
