    <h1>Hello.</h1>

    <h2>Welcome.</h2>

    <h3>I'm Saar Drimer and this is my homepage<em>.</em></h3>

    <p>
        I'm an <em>engineer</em> with an appreciation for <em>design</em>, art, culture, and how they're all combined into the things that I and others create. My greatest <em>fear</em> is to bore myself or be considered
        <em>boring</em> by others.
    </p>

    <p>
        I mostly <em>create</em> through
        <a href="https://boldport.com">Boldport</a>, my company and brand. Examples of my work are <a href="https://boldport.com/shop">here</a>, and some of it can be purchased
        <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/boldport">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My <a href="cv.html">CV</a> has the dry facts of my career so far; I kind-of look good on paper. I'm available for &mdash; and interested in! &mdash; <em>contracting</em> work and
        <em>commissions</em>. Please get in touch so we can discuss how I may be able to help.
    </p>

    <p>Here's some more about me:</p>

    <p>For three years I ran a service called <em>Boldport Club</em> where I sent unique <em>electronics</em> soldering projects that I designed every month to over 500 people all over the world. The Club <em>community</em> is marvellous and lives on <a href="https://discord.gg/hZhdtEh">Discord</a>. You can always find me there.

    <p>I created <a href="https://pcbmode.com">PCBmodE</a> to combine  <em>circuit-boards</em>, art, and coding, all of which I liked on their own. It's open source software written in Python and I'd love to continue developing it.

    <p>For a few years I was an <em>academic</em>, working on hardware and banking <em>security</em>. Stuff from those days is <a href="/sd410">here</a>.

    <p>I'm a compulsive doodler, not a morning person, and I really enjoy      <em>cooking</em>.

    <p>My name means <em>storm</em> in Hebrew.</li>

    <p>
        If you'd like to informally support my <em>work</em> you could
        <a href="https://ko-fi.com/saardrimer">buy me coffee</a> or sponsor my open source work through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/saardrimer">GitHub Sponsors</a>. Please <em>email</em> me &mdash; saardrimer@gmail.com or saar@boldport.com &mdash; with words of any kind.
    </p>

    <p>Take care, <br />Saar.</p>
