<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p><p>We present an AES cipher implementation that is based on the 
BlockRAM and DSP units embedded within Xilinx's Virtex-5 FPGAs. An 
iterative "basic" module outputs a 32 bit column of an AES round each 
clock cycle, with a throughput of 1.76 Gbit/s when processing two 128 
bit inputs. This construct is replicated four times for a 128 bit 
datapath for a full AES round with 6.21 Gbit/s throughput when 
processing eight inputs. Finally, the "round" module is replicated ten 
times for a fully unrolled design that yields over 55 Gbit/s of 
throughput. The combination and arrangement of the specialized embedded 
functions available in the FPGA allows us to implement our designs using
 very few traditional user logic elements such as flip-flops and lookup 
tables, yet still achieve these high throughputs. The complete source 
code for these designs is made publicly available for use in further 
research and for replicating our results. Our contribution ends with a 
discussion of comparing cipher implementations in the literature, and 
why these comparisons can be meaningless without a common reporting 
style, platform, or within the context of a specific constrained 
application.

<p>In the <a href="http://www.saardrimer.com/sd410/papers/aes_dsp.pdf">paper</a> we describe three variants for an AES implementation on Xilinx <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon_solutions/fpgas/virtex/virtex5/index.htm">Virtex-5</a> devices: "basic", "round", and "unrolled". Supplied here is the Verilog code for these designs and <a href="http://toolbox.xilinx.com/docsan/xilinx8/books/data/docs/dev/dev0191_28.html">XFLOW</a> commands for replicating the results we report, which are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>The results were achieved using XST and <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/ise/logic_design_prod/foundation.htm">ISE</a>
 version 9.2i.03, so if you compile the code using a different version, 
then you may get different results (might even exceed them). You will 
need to download the zip file below and use the command-line <a href="http://toolbox.xilinx.com/docsan/xilinx8/books/data/docs/dev/dev0191_28.html">XFLOW</a> program that is part of the ISE suite of tools.</p>

useful, please do try to let us know if you have used it in a product or
 academic paper.</em>

</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>
</p><p>The content of the BRAMs in the "unrolled" module is T(E)0, 
T(E)0', T(E)1, and T(E)1' for the first BRAM, and T(E)2, T(E)2', T(E)3, 
and T(E)3' for the other, for every instance. There is a control signal 
that tells the last round's instance to switch to Tn'. In other words, 
only 16 Kbits are used in each BRAM. Thus, if decryption is also needed,
 for the first nine rounds use T(E)0, T(D)0, T(E)1, and T(D)1 for the 
first BRAM, and T(E)2, T(D)2, T(E)3, and T(D)3. For the last round's 
BRAMs use the respective T(E/D)n' T-tables.
