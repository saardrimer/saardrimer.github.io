  abstract     = {Volatile FPGAs, the dominant type of programmable logic devices, are used in space, military, automotive, and consumer electronics applications which require them to operate in a wide range of environments. The continuous growth in both their capability and capacity now requires significant resources to be invested in the designs that are created for them. This has brought increased interest in the security attributes of FPGAs; specifically, how well do they protect the information processed within it, how are designs protected during distribution, and how developers' ownership rights are protected while designs from multiple sources are combined. This survey establishes the foundations for discussing ``FPGA security'', examines a wide range of attacks and defenses along with the current state of industry offerings, and finally, outlines on-going research and latest developments.},

  abstract     = {(Partial) The JBits software is a set of Java classes which provide an Application Programming Interface (API) to access the Xilinx FPGA bitstream. The interface operates on either bitstreams generated by Xilinx design tools, or on bitstreams read back from actual hardware. This permits all configurable resources like Look-up tables, routing and the flip-flops in the FPGA to be individually configured under software control.
The API has been used to construct complete circuits and to modify existing circuits. In addition, the object-oriented support in the Java programming language has permitted a small library of parameterizable, object oriented macro circuits or Cores to be implemented. Finally, this API may be used as a base to construct other tools. This includes traditional design tools for performing tasks such as circuit placement and routing, as well as application specific tools to perform more narrowly defined tasks.
The circuits developed can be downloaded on to the Xilinx hardware and probed using BoardScope. BoardScope is a graphical and interactive hardware debug tool for Xilinx FPGAs. It enables a user to look inside the chips and see the internal states and circuit configurations while the hardware is operating. The data is sampled using the readback capabilities of the FPGAs, and then graphically displayed. The interface to the hardware is provided by XHWIF, the Xilinx standard HardWare InterFace for FPGA based hardware.},

The generic nature of the FPGA base array allows the validation expense to be amortized over all designs targeted to that base array. Even the task of checking design tools is simplified by using non-destructive checks of the FPGA design.},

This paper introduces new technology that will provide the industry with an FPGA-based single chip cryptographic solution.
The National Security Agency (NSA) and Xilinx have been working together to bring the advantages of FPGA technology to the High Assurance industry.

  abstract     = {The distinct advantage of SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) is their flexibility for configuration changes. However; this opens up the threat of theft of Intellectual Property (IP) since the system configuration is stored in easy-to-access Flash memory. To prevent this, high-end FPGAs have already been extended with symmetric-key decryption engines used to load an encrypted version of the configuration that cannot simply be copied and used without knowledge of the secret key. However, such protection systems based on straightforward use of symmetric cryptography are not well-suited with respect to business and licensing processes, since they are lacking a convenient scheme for key transport and installation. We propose a new protection scheme for the IP of circuits in configuration bit files that provides a significant improvement to the current unsatisfying situation. It uses both public-key and symmetric cryptography, but does not burden FPGAs with the usual overhead of public-key cryptography: While it needs hard-wired symmetric cryptography, the public-key functionality is moved into a temporary configuration bit stream for a one-time setup procedure. This approach requires only very few modifications to current FPGA technology. Using five basic stages, the new protection scheme allows new accounting models for volume licensing of IP, with automated key installation on FPGAs taking place at the customer's site.},

The objective can be to preclude a system designer from fixing security vulnerabilities in a design. Such an attack can be performed over a network when the FPGA-based system is remotely updated or on the bus between the configuration memory and the FPGA chip at power-up. Several security schemes providing encryption and integrity checking of the bitstream have been proposed in the literature. However, as we show in this paper, they do not detect the replay of old FPGA configurations; hence they provide adversaries with the opportunity to downgrade the system. We thus propose a new architecture that, in addition to ensuring bitstream confidentiality and integrity, precludes replay of old bitstreams. We show that the hardware cost of this architecture is negligible.},

This paper proposes a solution to improve the security of SRAM FPGAs through flexible bitstream encryption. This proposition is distinct from other works because it uses the latest capabilities of SRAM FPGAs like partial dynamic reconfiguration and self reconfiguration. It does not need an external battery to store the secret key. It opens a new way of application partitioning oriented by the security policy.},

Products embedding FPGA system-on-chip solutions have the advantage in that they can be updated once deployed. New FPGA firmware may be loaded via manufacturer-supplied memory devices or remotely via a network connection. Recent FPGAs allow for self-reconfiguration, where the user-FPGA fabric can internally modify its own configuration data. Using self-reconfiguration, configuration control protocols can be implemented in user logic. This allows new FPGA programming methods to be designed. We propose a versatile partial self-reconfiguration framework for FPGA field updates that customizes to specific applications, reduces reconfiguration times, and minimizes the need for external hardware. The framework provides flexibility in media sources and design security. A prototype using this framework is demonstrated on a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA.},

In DPR systems, bitstream authentication is essential for avoiding fatal damage caused by unintended bitstreams. An encryption-only system can prevent bitstream cloning and reverse engineering, but cannot prevent erroneous or malicious bitstreams from being configured. Authenticated encryption is a relatively new concept that provides both message encryption and authentication, and AES-GCM is one of the latest authenticated encryption algorithms suitable for hardware implementation. We implemented the AES-GCM-based DPR system targeting the Virtex-5 device on an off-the-shelf board, and evaluated its throughput and hardware resource utilization. For comparison, we also implemented AES-CBC and SHA-256 modules on the same device. The experimental results showed that the AES-GCM-based system achieved higher throughput with less resource utilization than the AES/SHA-based system. The AES-GCM-module achieved more than 1 Gbps throughput and the entire system achieved about 800 Mbps throughput with reasonable resource utilization. This paper clarifies the advantage of using AES-GCM for protecting DPR systems.},

Also, there is no consensus among various manufactures as to which security features are absolutely essential for FPGA security. This paper addresses some security scenarios in FPGAs, and tries to point out why currently existing security features are inadequate. The concept of bitstream authentication is introduced and different authentication options are compared. Finally a comparative analysis of hardware implementations of the authentication algorithms is provided for FPGA as well as ASIC implementations.},

In this thesis, three new modes of operation, OCB, CCM and EAX, and two versions of the traditional scheme, based on AES for encryption, and HMAC-SHA1 and SHA-512 for authentication, have been compared from the point of view of efficiency of hardware implementations. All schemes have been implemented targeting Xilinx Virtex 4 family of FPGAs and a standard-cell ASIC based on 90 nm and 130 nm technology. All schemes have been compared from the point of view of the circuit area, implementation speed, inclusion in the current generation of standards, and a potential for future improvements.},

This research proposes a method which employs the addition of active decoy circuits to protect SRAM FPGAs from reverse engineering. The effects of the protection method on security, execution time, power consumption, and FPGA resource usage are quantified. The method significantly increases the security of the design with only minor increases in execution time, power consumption, and resource usage. For the circuits used to characterize the method, security increased to more than one million times the original values, while execution time increased to at most 1.2 times, dynamic power consumption increased to at most two times, and look-up table usage increased to at most seven times the original values. These are reasonable penalties given the size and security of the modified circuits. The proposed design protection method also extends to FPGAs based on other technologies and to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).},

This information has been used to create abits, a Java library for direct manipulation of FPSLIC bitstreams and partial reconfiguration. The abits library is accompanied by the slipway reference design, a low-cost USB bus-powered board carrying an FPSLIC.This paper describes the abits library and slipway platform, as well as a few applications which they make possible.

While not actually compromising current bitstream security, the easiness of the decompilation process should raise awareness aboutbitstream security issues. Available documentation from Xilinx and some custom assumptions about the bitstream format are presented and analyzed, so as to first gather a database mapping bitstream data to its related netlist elements, thanks to a suitable algorithm applied to a well-chosen bitstream. This database is then used as input to an efficient program which can compile a bitstream from a low-level textual description or conversely decompile a bitstream to the same textual description for any subsequent input. The whole process of database gathering and the decompilation of the bitstream format for a particular chip runs at about the speed of bitgen compilation. The sole process of compiling/decompiling a bitstream from/to its associated textual description runs two orders of magnitude faster.},

When they are deployed in non-networked environments, the question raises how this IP can be protected against non-authorized use. We describe an offline authentication scheme for IP modules. The scheme implements mutual authentication of the IP modules and the hardware platform, and enables us to provide authentication and integrity assurances to both the system developer and IP provider. Compared to the Trusted Computing Platforms approach to hardware, software authentication, our solution is more lightweight and tightly integrates with existing FPGA security features. We are able to demonstrate an implementation of the authentication scheme that requires a symmetric cipher and a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). In addition to the low hardware requirements, our implementation does not require any on-chip, non-volatile storage.},

The sale of the products containing this IP however have been. This is due in part to the way the IP is licensed. This research investigates the feasibility of physically enforced periodic licensing of FPGA IP. The goal is to design a hardware architecture to support licensable FPGA IP cores targeting consumer products. This work describes a method of licensing IP on FPGAs based on techniques derived from software licensing schemes. Current software and hardware licensing techniques are described in detail, including a survey of current research in the fields of FPGA security, secure memory technologies, and cryptography.

  abstract     = {SRAM FPGAs are configured by loading application-specific configuration data---the bitstream---into an internal configuration memory. Because the configuration memory is a SRAM volatile memory, it must be configured each time the device is powered up. The necessity of configuration on each power up makes it easier for attackers to clone, reverse engineer, or tamper the bitstream during configuration. Bitstream encryption is the most effective and practical solution to improve the security of SRAM FPGAs and protecting the configuration data. The existing Xilinx solution uses CAD tools support for bitstream encryption and an on-chip special circuit for decryption. One of the drawbacks of this solution is that it is not possible to use partial reconfiguration and readback when the device is configured with an encrypted bitstream. Partial reconfiguration changes the design behavior in a portion of the FPGA without full reconfiguration by using a partial bitstream. Different forms of this new capability provide many advantages such as run-time reconfiguration for various application areas.
This thesis investigates a method to perform a secure partial reconfiguration and improve the security of SRAM FPGAs through exploiting a configuration controller that enables an FPGA to dynamically reconfigure itself under the control of an embedded processor core. The hardware architecture of this configuration controller was implemented with a minimal footprint using two schemes: one based on hard-wired PowerPC processor core and the second based on MicroBlaze soft processor core. The software part of the controller consists of the program responsible for loading the configuration bitstream from external memory, authentication, decryption, and partial reconfiguration of the FPGA. This scheme enables embedded systems that benefit from partial reconfiguration to increase their design security without requiring external circuitry and provides flexibility by allowing the use of various authentication and encryption/decryption algorithms.
The scheme is tested for partially reconfigurable designs containing the configuration controller and an application system within a single FPGA. Comparison of the total configuration time (including authentication and decryption) and resource utilization targeting Xilinx Virtex-II Pro devices are also provided.},

This paper also presents a simple hardware/software infrastructure and its prototype implementation that allows for seamless integration of hardware IP into an existing simulation environment.

Digital devices external interfaces to memory and communications interfaces to other digital devices are vulnerable to malicious probing and examination. A hostile observer might be able to glean important details of a devices design from such an interface analysis. Defensive measures for protecting a device must therefore be even more sophisticated and robust. This thesis presents an architecture that acts as a secure wrapper around an embedded application on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The architecture includes functional units that serve to authenticate a user over a secure serial interface, create a key with multiple layers of security, and encrypt an external memory interface using that key. In this way, the wrapper protects all of the digital interfaces of the embedded application from external analysis. Cryptographic methods built into the system include an RSA-related secure key exchange, the Secure Hash Algorithm, a certificate storage system, and the Data Encryption Standard algorithm in counter mode. The principles behind the encrypted external memory interface and the secure authentication interface can be adjusted as needed to form a secure wrapper for a wide variety of embedded FPGA applications.},

Then, it discusses how this power consumption can be characterized in a statistical manner, what type of statistics are useful and how the statistics are related to one of the most important practical issues: how many measurements are needed in power analysis attacks. The core of the book are two chapters that discuss simple and differential power analysis attacks in detail. Finally, the book covers countermeasures such as masking and hiding, including special logic styles and also attacks on countermeasures, such as higher-order attacks.},

Large data flows have to be exchanged securely and involve encryption rates that sometimes may require hardware implementations. Reprogrammable devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays are highly attractive solutions for hardware implementations of encryption algorithms and several papers underline their growing performances and flexibility for any digital processing application. Although cryptosystem designers frequently assume that secret parameters will be manipulated in closed reliable computing environments, Kocher et al. stressed in 1998 that actual computers and microchips leak information correlated with the data handled. Side-channel attacks based on time, power and electromagnetic measurements were successfully applied to the smart card technology, but we have no knowledge of any attempt to implement them against FPGAs. This paper examines how monitoring power consumption signals might breach FPGA-security. We propose first experimental results against FPGA-implementations of cryptographic algorithms in order to confirm that power analysis has to be considered as a serious threat for FPGA security. We also highlight certain features of FPGAs that increase their resistance against side-channel attacks.},

We identify important resources in the FPGA architecture and obtain their utilization, using a large set of real designs. Then, using a number of representative case studies we calculate the switching activity corresponding to each resource. Finally, we combine effective capacitance of each resource with its utilization and switching activity to estimate its share of power consumption. According to our results, the power dissipation share of routing, logic and clocking resources are 60 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively. Also, we concluded that dynamic power dissipation of a Virtex-II CLB is 5.9 W per MHz for typical designs, but it may vary significantly depending on the switching activity.},

  abstract     = {Since their publication in 1998, power analysis attacks have attracted significant attention within the cryptographic community. So far, they have been successfully applied to different kinds of (unprotected) implementations of symmetric and public-key encryption schemes. However, most published attacks apply to smart cards and only a few publications assess the vulnerability of hardware implementations. In this paper we investigate the vulnerability of Rijndael FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) implementations to power analysis attacks. The design used to carry out the experiments is an optimized architecture with high clock frequencies, presented at CHES 2003. First, we provide a clear discussion of the hypothesis used to mount the attack. Then, we propose theoretical predictions of the attacks that we confirmed experimentally, which are the first successful experiments against an FPGA implementation of Rijndael. In addition, we evaluate the effect of pipelining and unrolling techniques in terms of resistance against power analysis. We also emphasize how the efficiency of the attack significantly depends on the knowledge of the design.},

  abstract     = {Cryptosystem designers frequently assume that secret parameters will be manipulated in tamper resistant environments. However, physical implementations can be extremely difficult to control and may result in the unintended leakage of side-channel information. In power analysis attacks, it is assumed that the power consumption is correlated to the data that is being processed. An attacker may therefore recover secret information by simply monitoring the power consumption of a device. Several articles have investigated power attacks in the context of smart card implementations. While FPGAs are becoming increasingly popular for cryptographic applications, there are only a few articles that assess their vulnerability to physical attacks. In this article, we demonstrate the specific properties of FPGAs w.r.t. Differential Power Analysis (DPA). First we emphasize that the original attack by Kocher et al.  and the improvements by Brier et al. do not apply directly to FPGAs because their physical behavior differs substantially from that of smart cards. Then we generalize the DPA attack to FPGAs and provide strong evidence that FPGA implementations of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) are vulnerable to such attacks.},

We first present some improved experiments against these reconfigurable devices, due to an improved measurement process. Although it is usually believed that FPGAs are noisy targets for such attacks, it is shown that simple power consumption models can nearly perfectly correlate with actual measurements. Then, we evaluate how these correlation values depend on the resources used in the FPGAs. Finally, we investigate the possibility to counteract these attacks by using random pre-charges in the devices and determine how this technique allows a designer to increase the security of an implementation. These results confirm that side-channel attacks present a serious threat for most microelectronic devices, including FPGAs. To conclude, we discuss the security vs. efficiency tradeoffs.},

  abstract     = {Since their publication in 1998 and 2001 respectively, Power and Electromagnetic Analysis (SPA, DPA, EMA) have been successfully used to retrieve secret information stored in cryptographic devices. Both attacks usually model the side-channel leakages using the so-called "Hamming weight" and "Hamming distance" models, i.e. they only consider the number of bit transitions in a device as an image of its leakage. In these models, the main difference between power and electromagnetic analysis is assumed to be the fact that the latter allows space localization (i.e. to observe the leakage of only a part of the cryptographic device). In this paper, we make use of a more accurate leakage model for CMOS devices and investigate its consequences. In particular, we show that it is practically feasible to distinguish between 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0 bit transitions in certain implementations and that electromagnetic analysis is particularly efficient in this respect. We denote this model as the "switching distance" leakage model and show how it may be very helpful to defeat some commonly used countermeasures (e.g. data buses precharged with random values). Then, we compare the different models and stress their respective constraints/advantages regarding practical attacks.},

In comments on this problem at the 2002 International Electron Devices Meeting, Intel chairman Andrew Grove cited off-state current leakage in particular as a limiting factor in future microprocessor integration. Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off. It is one of two principal sources of power dissipation in today’s microprocessors. The other is dynamic power, which arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today’s chips. Until very recently, only dynamic power has been a significant source of power consumption, and Moore’s law has helped to control it. Shrinking processor technology has allowed and, below 100 nanometers, actually required reducing the supply voltage. Dynamic power is proportional to the square of supply voltage, so reducing the voltage significantly reduces power consumption. Unfortunately, smaller geometries exacerbate leakage, so static power begins to dominate the power consumption equation in microprocessor design.},

Designers of cryptographic devices using such countermeasures to protect their devices have the challenging task to select and implement a suitable combination of countermeasures. Every device has different requirements, and so there is no universal solution to protect devices against DPA attacks. In this article, a statistical approach is pursued to determine the effect of hardware countermeasures on the number of samples needed in DPA attacks. This approach results in a calculation method that enables designers to assess the resistance of their devices against DPA attacks throughout the design process. This way, different combinations of countermeasures can be easily compared and costly design iterations can be avoided.},

Elliptic curve cryptography is a public key cryptosystem that is becoming increasingly popular. Implementations of cryptographic algorithms should not only be fast, compact and power efficient, but they should also resist side channel attacks. One of the side channels is the electromagnetic radiation out of an integrated circuit. Hence it is very important to assess the vulnerability of implementations of cryptosystems against these attacks. A SEMA attack on an unprotected implementation can find all the key bits with only one measurement. We also describe a DEMA attack on an improved implementation and demonstrate that a correlation analysis requires 1000 measurements to find the key bits.},

This information leakage differs substantially from and is more powerful than the leakage from other conventional side-channels such as timing and power. EM emanations are shown to consist of a multiplicity of compromising signals, each leaking somewhat different information. Our experimental results confirm that these signals could individually contain enough leakage to break cryptographic implementations and to defeat countermeasures against other side-channels such as power. Using techniques from Signal Detection Theory, we also show that generalized and far more devastating attacks can be constructed from an effective pooling of leakages from multiple signals derived from EM emanations.
The magnitude of EM exposure demands a leakage assessment methodology whose correctness can be rigorously proved. We define a model that completely and quantitatively bounds the information leaked from multiple (or all available) EM side-channel signals in CMOS devices and use that to develop a practical assessment methodology for devices such as chipcards.},

The flexibility of FPGAs is an important advantage in real applications but also in lab environments. It is therefore natural to use FPGAs to assess the vulnerability of hardware implementations to power-analysis attacks. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to describe a setup to conduct power-analysis attacks on FPGAs. We discuss the design of our hand-made FPGA-board and we provide a first characterization of the power consumption of a Virtex 800 FPGA. Finally we provide strong evidence that implementations of elliptic curve cryptosystems without specific countermeasures are indeed vulnerable to simple power-analysis attacks.},

The proposed technique exploits an active circuit to measure the instantaneous current consumption of a device under attack while supplying, at the same time, the device with a stable voltage. Higher gain-bandwidth product, higher sensitivity and lower insertion error are the main advantages with respect to a resistor-based measurement. Experimental results when the proposed circuit is used to measure the current consumption of an FPGA are reported and the achievable advantage in terms of sensitivity is discussed too.},

  abstract     = {Electronic equipment can emit unintentional signals from which eavesdroppers may reconstruct processed data at some distance. This has been a concern for military hardware for over half a century. The civilian computer-security community became aware of the risk through the work of van Eck in 1985. Military “Tempest” shielding test standards remain secret and no civilian equivalents are available at present. The topic is still largely neglected in security textbooks due to a lack of published experimental data.
This report documents eavesdropping experiments on contemporary computer displays. It discusses the nature and properties of compromising emanations for both cathode-ray tube and liquid-crystal monitors. The detection equipment used matches the capabilities to be expected from well-funded professional eavesdroppers. All experiments were carried out in a normal unshielded office environment. They therefore focus on emanations from display refresh signals, where periodic averaging can be used to obtain reproducible results in spite of varying environmental noise.
Additional experiments described in this report demonstrate how to make information emitted via the video signal more easily receivable, how to recover plaintext from emanations via radio-character recognition, how to estimate remotely precise video-timing parameters, and how to protect displayed text from radio-frequency eavesdroppers by using specialized screen drivers with a carefully selected video card. Furthermore, a proposal for a civilian radio-frequency emission-security standard is outlined, based on path-loss estimates and published data about radio noise levels.
Finally, a new optical eavesdropping technique is demonstrated that reads CRT displays at a distance. It observes high-frequency variations of the light emitted, even after diffuse reflection. Experiments with a typical monitor show that enough video signal remains in the light to permit the reconstruction of readable text from signals detected with a fast photosensor. Shot-noise calculations provide an upper bound for this risk. },

We propose an adversarial model which combines a CMOS leakage model and the maximum-likelihood principle for performing and analyzing such attacks. This model is essential for deriving the optimal and very often counter-intuitive techniques for channel selection and data analysis. We show that using multiple channels is better for template attacks by experimentally showing a three-fold reduction in the error probability. Developing sound countermeasures against multi-channel attacks requires a rigorous leakage assessment methodology. Under suitable assumptions and approximations, our model also yields a practical assessment methodology for net information leakage from the power and all available EM channels in constrained devices such as chip-cards. Classical DPA/DEMA style attacks assume an adversary weaker than that of our model. For this adversary, we apply the maximum-likelihood principle to such design new and more efficient single and multiple-channel DPA/DEMA attacks.},

These attacks can break implementations and countermeasures whose security is dependent on the assumption that an adversary cannot obtain more than one or a limited number of side channel samples. They require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. The success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. In contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. We describe in detail how an implementation of RC4, not amenable to techniques such as SPA and DPA, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. Other applications include attacks on certain DES implementations which use DPA-resistant hardware and certain SSL accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an RSA operation even from distances of fifteen feet.},

The Trusted Computing Group has proposed specifications for a Trusted Platform Module and a Mobile Trusted Module.

In this paper, we describe a solution to protect the trusted module’s persistent state in external memory against non-invasive attacks. We introduce a minimal cryptographic protocol to achieve an authenticated channel between the trusted module and the external non-volatile memory. A MAC algorithm has to be added to the external memory to ensure authenticity. As a case study, we discuss trusted computing on reconfigurable hardware. In order to make our solution applicable to the low-end FPGA series which has no security measures on board, we present a solution that only relies on the reverse engineering complexity of the undocumented bitstream encoding and uses a physically unclonable function for one-time-programmable key storage. Clearly, this solution is also applicable to high-end series with special security measures on board. Our solution also supports field updates of the trusted module.},

The TrustedComputing Group (TCG) has proposed several specifications to implement TC functionalities by extensions to common computing platforms, particularly the underlying hardware with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
However, actual TPMs are mostly available for workstations and servers nowadays and rather for specific domainapplications and not primarily for embedded systems. Further, the TPM specifications are becoming monolithic andmore complex while the applications demand a scalable and flexible usage of TPM functionalities.
In this paper we propose a reconfigurable (hardware) architecture with TC functionalities where we focus on TPMsas proposed by the TCG specifically designed for embedded platforms. Our approach allows for (i) an efficient andscalable design and update of TPM functionalities, in particular for hardware-based crypto engines and accelerators, (ii) establishing a minimal trusted computing base in hardware, (iii) including the TPM as well as its functionalities into the chain of trust that enables to bind sensitive data to the underlying reconfigurable hardware, and (iv) designing a manufacturer independent TPM. We discuss possible implementations based on current FPGAs and point out the associated challenges, in particular with respect to protection of the internal TPM state since it must not be subject to manipulation, replay, and cloning},

From these specialist beginnings, cryptoprocessors spread into devices such as prepayment electricity meters, and the vending machines that sell credit for them. In the 90s, tamper-resistant smartcards became integral to GSM mobile phone identification and to key management in pay-TV set-top boxes, while secure microcontrollers were used in remote key entry devices for cars. In the last five years, dedicated crypto chips have been embedded in devices from games console accessories to printer ink cartridges, to control product and accessory aftermarkets. The Trusted Computing initiative will soon embed cryptoprocessors in PCs so that they can identify each other remotely. This paper surveys the range of applications of tamper-resistant hardware, and the array of attack and defence mechanisms which have evolved in the tamper-resistance arms race.},

In this paper, we describe a number of attacks that can be mounted by opponents with much shallower pockets. Three of them involve special (but low cost) equipment: differential fault analysis, chip rewriting, and memory remanence. There are also attacks based on good old fashioned protocol failure which may not require any special equipment at all. We describe and give examples of each of these. Some of our attacks are significant improvements on the state of the art; others are useful cautionary tales. Together, they show that building tamper resistant devices, and using them effectively, is much harder that it looks.},

We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems — BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt — using no special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay.

  abstract     = {(Partial) Semiconductor chips are used today not only to control systems, but also to protect them against security threats. A continuous battle is waged between manufacturers who invent new security solutions, learning their lessons from previous mistakes, and the hacker community, constantly trying to break implemented protections. Some chip manufacturers do not pay enough attention to the proper design and testing of protection mechanisms. Even where they claim their products are highly secure, they do not guarantee this and do not take any responsibility if a device is compromised. In this situation, it is crucial for the design engineer to have a convenient and reliable method of testing secure chips.
This thesis presents a wide range of attacks on hardware security in microcontrollers and smartcards. This includes already known non-invasive attacks, such as power analysis and glitching, and invasive attacks, such as reverse engineering and microprobing. A new class of attacks---semi-invasive attacks---is introduced. Like invasive attacks, they require depackaging the chip to get access to its surface. But the passivation layer remains intact, as these methods do not require electrical contact to internal lines. Semi-invasive attacks stand between noninvasive and invasive attacks. They represent a greater threat to hardware security, as they are almost as effective as invasive attacks but can be low-cost like non-invasive attacks.},

In non-volatile programmable devices, such as UV EPROM, EEPROM or Flash, bits are stored as charge in the floating gate of a transistor. After each erase operation, some of this charge remains. Security protection in microcontrollers and smartcards with EEPROM/Flash memories is based on the assumption that information from the memory disappears completely after erasing. While microcontroller manufacturers successfully hardened already their designs against a range of attacks, they still have a common problem with data remanence in floating-gate transistors. Even after an erase operation, the transistor does not return fully to its initial state, thereby allowing the attacker to distinguish between previously programmed and not programmed transistors, and thus restore information from erased memory. The research in this direction is summarised here and it is shown how much information can be extracted from some microcontrollers after their memory has been erased.},

However, functional security mechanisms alone cannot ensure security, since most embedded systems present attackers with an abundance of opportunities to observe or interfere with their implementation, and hence to compromise their theoretical strength.

This work extends the brief coverage of this area given in the earlier paper by providing the technical background information necessary to understand remanence issues in semiconductor devices. Data remanence problems affect not only obvious areas such as RAM and non-volatile memory cells but can also occur in other areas of the device through hot-carrier effects (which change the characteristics of the semiconductors in the device), electromigration (which physically alter the device itself), and various other effects which are examined alongside the more obvious memory-cell remanence problems. The paper concludes with some design and device usage guidelines which can be useful in reducing remanence effects.},

This technology requires constant review and improvement, just as other competitive technologies need review to stay at the leading edge.
This paper describes known physical attacks, ranging from simple attacks that require little skill or resource, to complex attacks that require trained, technical people and considerable resources. Physical security methods to deter or prevent these attacks are presented. The intent is to match protection methods with the attack methods in terms of complexity and cost. In this way cost effective protection can be produced across a wide range of systems and needs.
Specific technical mechanisms now in use are shown, as well as mechanisms proposed for future use. Common design problems and solutions are discussed with consideration for manufacturing.},

They must resist system-level attacks, whether by software or hardware, and whether the attack is intended to produce incorrect results or to expose information that should be protected. The details of these requirements change over time. Both attack and defensive technologies improve, turning difficult attacks into easy ones, or expensive defenses into inexpensive ones. The current standard for the security of cryptographic systems is FIPS 140, which lays out four levels of security that have increasingly stringent requirements. This paper argues that changing attack technologies and application requirements have led to a gap in FIPS 140, and that a new level is needed. Such a level is proposed, intermediate between the two highest levels of FIPS 140. The new level allows the validation of commercially feasible products that are more secure than the current Level 3, but that do not carry the difficult burden imposed by the current Level 4 validation requirements.},

Furthermore, secure coprocessors that support general-purpose computation and will be manufactured and distributed as commercial products must provide these core sanctuary and authentication properties while also meeting many additional challenges, including:
  - the applications, operating system, and underlying security management may all come from different, mutually suspicious authorities;
  - configuration and maintenance must occur in a hostile environment, while minimizing disruption of operations;
  - the device must be able to recover from the vulnerabilities that inevitably emerge in complex software;
  - physical security dictates that the device itself can never be opened and examined; and
  - ever-evolving cryptographic requirements dictate that hardware accelerators be supported by reloadable on-card software.

It is beyond question that such systems must contain mechanisms making them reliable through fault-detection or fault-tolerance. For monetary reasons, one or multiple Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used in modern Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) development systems before production. Hardware manufacturers have a strong focus on quick fault-injection to verify and validate the correct function of such a (faulttolerant) system. However, current FPGA-based fault injection schemes do not consider delay faults. In this paper we present an extension to traditional FPGA fault injection schemes without any additional hardware for fixed and small hardware overhead for dynamic phase shifting. By using digital clock managers (DCMs), we are able to inject delay faults very fast through phase-shift variation of the clock without reconfiguring the FPGA.},

By interconnecting a set of nodes in a random way one can model very complicated non-linear dynamic systems. Although random Boolean networks (RBN) use Boolean functions as their basic component, there are not hardware implementations of such systems. The absence of implementations is mainly due to the arbitrary connections exhibited by the network, and connection flexibility use to be very expensive in terms of hardware resources. In this paper we present an on chip self-reconfigurable approach for providing a flexible connections at very low resource cost by partially reconfiguring Virtex II FPGAs.},

In contrast to the conventional cores, the evolvable cores are able to perform autonomous evolution of their internal circuits. The cores should be available in the form of HDL source code, i.e. they should be synthesizable into any reconfigurable device of a sufficient capacity. The approach is based on implementation of a virtual reconfigurable circuit and a genetic unit in an ordinary FPGA. In the presented case study an adaptive image filter is designed, implemented and synthesized. The proposed idea of evolvable IP core could open the way towards defining a business model for evolvable hardware.},

A number of circuits were successfully evolved directly in the FPGA, in particular, 3-bit multipliers, adders, multiplexers and parity encoders.

A major advantage of using PK-based protocols is that they do not require the private key stored in the FPGA to leave the device, thus increasing security. This added security comes at the cost of additional hardware resources but it does not cause significant performance degradation.},

We show that instead of relying on number theory, the mesoscopic physics of coherent transport through a disordered medium can be used to allocate and authenticate unique identifiers by physically reducing the medium's microstructure to a fixed-length string of binary digits. These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant. We provide an authentication protocol based on the enormous address space that is a principal characteristic of physical one-way functions.},

In real life, however, the black box approach is not sufficient because attackers have access to many physical means that enable them to derive information on the secret keys. In order to limit the attacker's ability to read out secret information, the concept of Algorithmic Tamper Proof (ATP) security is needed as put forth by Gennaro, Lysyanskaya, Malkin, Micali and Rabin. An essential component to achieve ATP security is read-proof hardware. In this paper, we develop an implementation of read-proof hardware that is resistant against invasive attacks. The construction is based on a hardware and a cryptographic part. The hardware consists of a protective coating that contains a lot of randomness. By performing measurements on the coating a fingerprint is derived. The cryptographic part consists of a Fuzzy Extractor that turns this fingerprint into a secure key. Hence no key is present in the non-volatile memory of the device. It is only constructed at the time when needed, and deleted afterwards. A practical implementation of the hardware and the cryptographic part is given. Finally, experimental evidence is given that an invasive attack on an IC equipped with this coating, reveals only a small amount of information on the key.},

The technique relies on hosting the bits of a digital signature at the HDL design level using combinational logic included within the original system. Thus, any attack trying to change or remove the digital signature will damage the design. The technique also includes a procedure for secure signature extraction. The new advances refer to increasing the applicability of this watermarking technique to any design and the provision of an automatic tool for signature hosting purposes. The design examples on FPL devices show the effectiveness of this watermarking technique. Synthesis results show that the application of the proposed watermarking strategy results in negligible degradation of system performance and very low area penalties.},

This is the first watermarking method, where the signature is extracted in this way. We are able to sign cores at the netlist as well as the bitfile level, so a wide spectrum of cores can be protected. The power watermarking method works with all types of FPGAs, but with Xilinx FPGAs, we can integrate the watermarking algorithms and the signature into the functionality of the watermarked core. So it is very hard to remove the watermark without destroying the core. We introduce a detection algorithm which can decode the signature from a voltage trace with high probability. Additionally, a second algorithm is introduced which improves the detection probability in case of considerable noise sources. Using this algorithm, it is possible to decode the signature even if other cores operate on the same device at the same time.},

In this paper, we describe the basic requirements, make the necessary assumptions, and propose several practical schemes for HDL code protection.
We protect the HDL codes by hiding author's signature also called as watermarking, similar to the idea for hard IP and multimedia data protection. But the new challenge is how to embed watermark into HDL source codes, which must be properly documented and synthesizable for
reuse. We leverage the unique feature of Verilog HDL design to develop several watermarking techniques. These techniques can protect both new and existing Verilog designs. We watermark SCU-RTL & ISCAS benchmark Verilog circuits, as well as a MP3 decoder. Both original and watermarked designs are implemented on ASICs & FPGAs. The results show that the proposed techniques survive the commercial synthesis tools and cause little design overhead in terms of area/resources, delay and power.},

  abstract     = {We analyze four recently proposed watermarking schemes for intellectual property protection of digital designs. The first scheme watermarks solutions of a hard optimization problem, namely the graph coloring problem. The other three schemes belong to a family of techniques for watermarking digital circuits on programmable hardware. They are different from the usual image and audio watermarking since they must maintain correctness of the watermarked objects. Thus their watermarks cannot be embedded in the form of small errors as usually done in audio and visual watermarking. Although constraint-based watermarking schemes existed long before, these schemes are the first ones to protect hardware designs. In this paper, we apply a novel method to break the first of these schemes. We show how to modify a watermarked object in such a way that every signature strings can be extracted from it. Thus anyone can claim ownership of the object, yet leave no traces of who leaked the object. According to our best knowledge, this method is new and it may be of its own interest. In the remaining three schemes, we show how to locate and to remove the watermark embedded in the object, without knowing the secret key used in the embedding.},

Sharing IP blocks in such a competitive market poses significant high security risks. IPs can be read, copied or even partitioned to cover the authorship proof. Creators and owners of IP designs want assurance that their content will not be illegally redistributed by consumers. Consumers, on the other hand, want assurance that the content they buy is legitimate. Digital watermarking, used with most of the shared digital media, has emerged as a candidate solution for helping copyright protection of IP blocks. In this paper, we outline IP watermarking and survey the current state-of- the-art of different schemes and algorithms. We also highlight the main technical problems that should be solved in order to let IP watermarking be used widely in industry.},

Existing watermarking and fingerprinting techniques successfully embed identification information into FPGA designs to deter IP infringement. However, such methods incur timing and/or resource overhead, unpredictable at times, which causes performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a new FPGA watermarking technique that guarantees zero design overhead.
Our approach consists of two phases. First we design as usual to obtain the best, possible, quality IP. Then we map the required signature to additional timing constraints on carefully selected nets and redo a small portion of the design (e.g. place and route). The FPGA configuration bitstream for the resulting watermarked design will be significantly different from the original design, which provides us with a strong proof of authorship. The watermarking technique has zero design overhead because it is developed to maintain the performance of the design from the first phase. This is demonstrated by applying the proposed technique on several real-life FPGA designs, which range in size from a few thousand to more than two million gates, on Xilinx devices.},

We survey related work in cryptography and design methodology, then develop desiderata, metrics, and concrete protocols for constraint-based watermarking at various stages of the very large scale integration (VLSI) design process. In particular, we propose a new preprocessing approach that embeds watermarks as constraints into the input of a black-box design tool and a new post processing approach that embeds watermarks as constraints into the output of a black-box design tool. To demonstrate that our protocols can be transparently integrated into existing design flows, we use a testbed of commercial tools for VLSI physical design and embed watermarks into real-world industrial designs. We show that the implementation overhead is low---both in terms of central processing unit time and such standard physical design metrics as wirelength, layout area, number of vias, and routing congestion. We empirically show that in the placement and routing applications considered in our methods achieve strong proofs of authorship are resistant to tampering and do not adversely influence timing.},

An iterative ``basic'' module outputs a 32 bit column of an AES round each clock cycle, with a throughput of 1.76 Gbit/s when processing two 128 bit inputs. This construct is replicated four times for a 128 bit datapath for a full AES round with 6.21 Gbit/s throughput when processing eight inputs. Finally, the ``round'' module is replicated ten times for a fully unrolled design that yields over 55 Gbit/s of throughput. The combination and arrangement of the specialized embedded functions available in the FPGA allows us to implement our designs using very few traditional user logic elements such as flip-flops and lookup tables, yet still achieve these high throughputs. The complete source code for these designs is made publicly available for use in further research and for replicating our results. Our contribution ends with a discussion of comparing cipher implementations in the literature, and why these comparisons can be meaningless without a common reporting style, platform, or within the context of a specific constrained application.},

Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.
This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than EUR 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.}

Two AES encryption/decryption cores have been designed and implemented on a prototyping XC2VP20-7 FPGA: a completely unrolled loop structure capable of achieving a throughput above 34 Gbits/s, with an implementation cost of 3513 slices and 80 BRAMs; and a fully folded structure, requiring only 515 slices and 12 BRAMs, capable of a throughput above 2 Gbits/s. To evaluate the proposed AES design, it has been embedded in a polymorphic processor organization, as a reconfigurable co-processor. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AES cores indicate that the proposed unfolded core outperforms the most recent works by 34\% in throughput and requires 68\% less reconfigurable area. Experimental results of both folded and unfolded AES cores suggest over 560\% improvement in the throughput/slice metric when compared to the recent AES related art.}

  abstract     = {Due to the exponential growth of wireless and mobile applications, security has become a paramount design aspect. New techniques have been proposed for replacing the broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, which arguably is the most widely security tool used up to now in wireless environments. Under this scenario, AES in CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC) mode has been included in the IEEE 802.11i wireless standard as a promising alternative to the compromised WEP protocol. In this contribution, we present an FPGA implementation of the CCM mode of operation using AES as its block cipher. Our design achieves a throughput of 1.05 Gbits/Sec with reasonable area requirements.},

  abstract     = {Hardware implementations of the advanced encryption standard (AES) Rijndael algorithm have recently been the object of an intensive evaluation. Several papers describe efficient architectures for ASICs and FPGAs. In this context, the highest effort was devoted to high throughput (up to 20 Gbps) encryption-only designs, fewer works studied low area encryption-only architectures and only a few papers have investigated low area encryption/decryption structures. However, in practice, only a few applications need throughput up to 20 Gbps while flexible and low cost encryption/decryption solutions are needed to protect sensible data, especially for embedded hardware applications. We purpose an efficient solution to combine Rijndael encryption and decryption in one FPGA design, with a strong focus on low area constraints. The proposed design fits into the smallest Xilinx FPGAs, deals with data streams of 208 Mbps, uses 163 slices and 3 RAM blocks and improves by 68\% the best-known similar designs in terms of ratio Throughput/Area. We also propose implementations in other FPGA Families (Xilinx Virtex-II) and comparisons with similar DES, triple-DES and AES implementations.},

  abstract     = {Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters (in particular the key length) of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (assuming no mathematical breakthrough) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.
This contribution presents the design and realization of the COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker) machine, which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms and can be realized for less than USD 10,000. It will be shown that, depending on the actual algorithm, the architecture can outperform conventional computers by several orders in magnitude. COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to, e.g., perform an exhaustive key search of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days on average. As a real-world application, our architecture can be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass). COPACOBANA is intended, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.
The hardware architecture is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. Even though breaking full-size RSA (1024 bit or more) or elliptic curves (ECC with 160 bit or more) is out of reach with COPACOBANA, it can be used to analyze cryptosystems with a (deliberately chosen) small bitlength to provide reliable security estimates of RSA and ECC by extrapolation.},

For feedback cipher modes, all AES candidates have been implemented using the basic iterative architecture, and achieved speeds ranging from 61 Mbit/s for Mars to 431 Mbit/s for Serpent. For non-feedback cipher modes, four AES candidates have been implemented using a high-throughput architecture with pipelining inside and outside of cipher rounds, and achieved speeds ranging from 12.2 Gbit/s for Rijndael to 16.8 Gbit/s for Serpent.

Our goal is to evaluate the suitability of the aforementioned algorithms for FPGA-based implementations. Among the various time-space implementation tradeoffs, we focused primarily on time performance. The time performance metrics are throughput and key-setup latency. Throughput corresponds to the amount of data processed per time unit while the key-setup latency time is the minimum time required to commence encryption after providing the input key. Time performance and area requirement results are pro- vided for all the final AES candidates. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any published results that include key-setup latency results. Our results suggest that Rijndael and Serpent favor FPGA implementations the most since their algorithmic characteristics match extremely well with the hardware characteristics of FPGAs.},

Manufactured by Texas Instruments, DST (and variant) devices help secure millions of SpeedPassTM payment transponders and automobile ignition keys. Our analysis of the DST involved three phases:
1. Reverse engineering: Starting from a rough published schematic, we determined the complete functional details of the cipher underpinning the challenge-response protocol in the DST. We accomplished this with only ``oracle'' or ``black-box'' access to an ordinary DST, that is, by experimental observation of responses output by the device.
2. Key cracking: The key length for the DST is only 40 bits. With an array of of sixteen FPGAs operating in parallel, we can recover a DST key in under an hour using two responses to arbitrary challenges.
3. Simulation: Given the key (and serial number) of a DST, we are able to simulate its RF output so as to spoof a reader. As validation of our results, we purchased gasoline at a service station and started an automobile using simulated DST devices.
We accomplished all of these steps using inexpensive off-the-shelf equipment, and with minimal RF expertise. This suggests that an attacker with modest resources can emulate a target DST after brief short-range scanning or long-range eavesdropping across several authentication sessions. We conclude that the cryptographic protection afforded by the DST device is relatively weak},

Many scientists and engineers have known or suspected this for years. The ones who know exactly what the government is doing have been unable to tell the public, fearing prosecution for revealing "classified" information. Those who are only guessing have been reluctant to publish their guesses, for fear that they have guessed wrong.
This book describes a machine which we actually built to crack DES. The machine exists, and its existence can easily be verified. You can buy one yourself, in the United States; or can build one yourself if you desire. The machine was designed and built in the private sector, so it is not classified. We have donated our design to the public domain, so it is not proprietary. There is no longer any question that it can be built or has been built. We have published its details so that other scientists and engineers can review, reproduce, and build on our work. There can be no more doubt. DES is not secure. },

One of the authors had previously proposed a theoretical attack to extract DES keys from the system, but it failed to take account of real-world banking security practice. We developed a practical scheme that collected the necessary data in a single 10-minute session. Risk of discovery by intrusion detection systems made it necessary to complete the key ``cracking''' part of the attack within a few days, so a hardware DES cracker was implemented on a USD 995 off-the-shelf FPGA development board. This gave a 20-fold increase in key testing speed over the use of a standard 800 MHz PC. The attack was not only successful in its aims, but also shed new light on the protocol vulnerabilities being exploited. In addition, the FPGA development led to a fresh way of demonstrating the non-randomness of some of the DES S-boxes and indicated when pipelining can be a more effective technique than replication of processing blocks. The wide range of insights we obtained demonstrates that there can be significant value in implementing attacks ``for real''.},

Using these techniques, four architectures with different level of parallelism, trading off area for performance, are described and their implementations on a Virtex-E FPGA part are presented.

Our work refines this approach to achieve a more compact S-box. We examined many choices of basis for each subfield, not only polynomial bases as in previous work, but also normal bases, giving 432 cases. The isomorphism bit matrices are fully optimized, improving on the ``greedy algorithm.'' Introducing some NOR gates gives further savings. The best case improves on [14] by 20 per-cent. This decreased size could help for area-limited hardware implementations, e.g., smart cards, and to allow more copies of the S-box for parallelism and/or pipelining of AES.},

Hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms have a long history. Traditionally, algorithms were implemented in hardware to achieve a higher speed than with implementations in software. The requirements of contemporary and future applications however, demand often other properties of hardware implementations. Today we can identify two application scenarios where hardware implementations are advantageous over software implementations. Firstly, these are high-speed applications where a cryptographic co-processor performs the cryptographic operations in order to relieve the rest of the system. Secondly, these are applications where low power and low area requirements are stringent. In both application scenarios, the secure storage of keys is important. In this deliverable we survey hardware architectures that are suitable for cryptographic applications. In particular, we analyze various hardware implementations of the AES algorithm. The focus of this survey will be on throughput-optimized circuits and on circuits designed for operation in very constricted environments where the power budget and the silicon area are sparse resources. In order to provide a profound analysis of existing AES hardware we describe the AES algorithm briefly. The analysis of existing AES hardware shows considerations for light-weight implementations and for high-performance implementations. For both implementation goals, pointers and references to state-of-the-art implementations are given. Concepts and design considerations behind these implementations, which allow to push the limits of AES hardware implementations, are summarized in a compact manner.},

Reprogrammable devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are highly attractive options for hardware implementations of encryption algorithms, as they provide cryptographic algorithm agility, physical security, and potentially much higher performance than software solutions. This contribution investigates the significance of FPGA implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard candidate algorithms. Multiple architectural implementation options are explored for each algorithm. A strong focus is placed on high-throughput implementations, which are required to support security for current and future high bandwidth applications. Finally, the implementations of each algorithm will be compared in an effort to determine the most suitable candidate for hardware implementation within commercially available FPGAs.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a hardware implementation of the SBoxes from the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The SBoxes substitute an 8-bit input for an 8-bit output and are based on arithmetic operations in the finite field GF(28). We show that a calculation of this function and its inverse can be done efficiently with combinational logic. This approach has advantages over a straight-forward implementation using read-only memories for table lookups. Most of the functionality is used for both encryption and decryption. The resulting circuit offers low transistor count, has low die-size, is convenient for pipelining, and can be realized easily within a semi-custom design methodology like a standard-cell design. Our standard cell implementation on a 0.6 um CMOS process requires an area of only 0.108 mm2 and has delay below 15 ns which equals a maximum clock frequency of 70 MHz. These results were achieved without applying any speed optimization techniques like pipelining.},

Their approval is subject to an extensive suite of evaluation and certification procedures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tamper proofing of PEDs is unsatisfactory, as is the certification process. We have implemented practical low-cost attacks on two certified, widely-deployed PEDs - the Ingenico 13300 and the Dione Xtreme. By tapping inadequately protected smartcard communications, an attacker with basic technical skills can expose card details and PINs, leaving cardholders open to fraud. We analyze the anti-tampering mechanisms of the two PEDs and show that, while the specific protection measures mostly work as intended, critical vulnerabilities arise because of the poor integration of cryptographic, physical and procedural protection. As these vulnerabilities illustrate a systematic failure in the design process, we propose a methodology for doing it better in the future. These failures also demonstrate a serious problem with the Common Criteria. So we discuss the incentive structures of the certification process, and show how they can lead to problems of the kind we identified. Finally we recommend changes to the Common Criteria framework in light of the lessons learned.},

In the paper, we describe the methodology by which the measurements were obtained and we show that, for circuits containing only combinational logic and flip-flops, the ratio of silicon area required to implement them in FPGAs and ASICs is on average 40. Modern FPGAs also contain "hard" blocks such as multiplier/accumulators and block memories and we find that these blocks reduce this average area gap significantly to as little as 21. The ratio of critical path delay, from FPGA to ASIC, is roughly 3 to 4, with less influence from block memory and hard multipliers. The dynamic power onsumption ratio is approximately 12 times and, with hard blocks, this gap generally becomes smaller.},

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of soft IP cores, often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices. We carefully quantify the required overheads on real FPGAs and demonstrate the utility of our methods by applying them to the practical problem of memory protection.},

  abstract     = {We present a model for attacking various cryptographic schemes by taking advantage of random hardware faults. The model consists of a black-box containing some cryptographic secret. The box interacts with the outside world by following a cryptographic protocol. The model supposes that from time to time the box is affected by a random hardware fault causing it to output incorrect values. For example, the hardware fault flips an internal register bit at some point during the computation. We show that for many digital signature and identification schemes these incorrect outputs completely expose the secrets stored in the box. We present the following results: (1) The secret signing key used in an implementation of RSA based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is completely exposed from a single erroneous RSA signature, (2) for non-CRT implementations of RSA the secret key is exposed given a large number (e.g. 1000) of erroneous signatures, (3) the secret key used in Fiat—Shamir identification is exposed after a small number (e.g. 10) of faulty executions of the protocol, and (4) the secret key used in Schnorr's identification protocol is exposed after a much larger number (e.g. 10,000) of faulty executions. Our estimates for the number of necessary faults are based on standard security parameters such as a 1024-bit modulus, and a 2^(-40) identification error probability. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing errors in cryptographic computations. We conclude the paper with various methods for preventing these attacks.},

Basic assumptions about statistical properties of jitter signal are confirmed by testing of mean value of the TRNG output signal. The quality of generated true random numbers is confirmed by passing standard NIST statistical tests. The described TRNG is tailored for embedded System-On-a-Programmable-Chip (SOPC) cryptographic applications and can provide a good quality true random bit-stream with throughput of several tens of kilobits per second.

The tension is common enough to justify an architectural solution, rather than a set of context-specific solutions. The Programmable Protocol Processing Pipeline (P4) design uses programmable hardware to selectively accelerate protocol processing functions. A set of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and an associated library of network processing modules implemented in hardware are augmented with software support for function selection and composition, and applied to processing-intensive portions of a user-programmable protocol stack. The system is sufficiently flexible to support protocol stacks that are dynamically altered in reaction to changing network conditions or user needs.The P4 can be transparently inserted into a conventional protocol architecture, such as that of TCP/IP. This experimental demonstration shows that the P4's programmability can be used to significantly improve the performance of TCP/IP under operating conditions where the protocol would perform poorly without augmentation. Generalizing from these experiments, the P4 is shown to have many applications as an open platform for implementing adaptive and programmable networks, and has illustrated new security issues that arise in FPGA-based architectures.The P4 and closely-related systems, such as network processors, are attractive architectural solutions to balancing performance and flexibility.},

Although extracting secrets out of smartcards requires resources beyond the means of many would-be thieves, the manner in which they are used can be exploited for fraud. Cardholders authorize financial transactions by presenting the card and disclosing a PIN to a terminal without any assurance as to the amount being charged or who is to be paid, and have no means of discerning whether the terminal is authentic or not. Even the most advanced smartcards cannot protect customers from being defrauded by the simple relaying of data from one location to another. We describe the development of such an attack, and show results from live experiments on the UK's EMV implementation, Chip & PIN. We discuss previously proposed defences, and show that these cannot provide the required security assurances. A new defence based on a distance bounding protocol is described and implemented, which requires only modest alterations to current hardware and software. As far as we are aware, this is the first complete design and implementation of a secure distance bounding protocol. Future smartcard generations could use this design to provide cost-effective resistance to relay attacks, which are a genuine threat to deployed applications. We also discuss the security-economics impact to customers of enhanced authentication mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Radio-frequency identification tokens, such as contactless smartcards, are vulnerable to relay attacks if they are used for proximity authentication. Attackers can circumvent the limited range of the radio channel using transponders that forward exchanged signals over larger distances. Cryptographic distance-bounding protocols that measure accurately the round-trip delay of the radio signal provide a possible countermeasure. They infer an upper bound for the distance between the reader and the token from the fact that no information can propagate faster than at the speed of light. We propose a new distance-bounding protocol based on ultra-wideband pulse communication. Aimed at being implementable using only simple, asynchronous, low-power hardware in the token, it is particularly well suited for use in passive low-cost tokens, noisy environments and high-speed applications.},

Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of chip processes as they come into commercial production. Chipworks has obtained parts from leading edge manufacturers, and performed structural analyses to examine the features and manufacturing processes of the devices. The paper shows how ``90nm'' has been interpreted by various vendors, details the physical transistor structures we have analyzed, and comments on the introduction of strain into CMOS processing.},

A common approach for guaranteeing high performance is to include specialized coprocessor units. However, these systems lack flexibility, since one must define, in advance, the coprocessor functionality. A solution to this problem is to use run-time reconfigurable coprocessors, exploiting the advantages of hardware while keeping a flexible platform. In this paper, we describe a self-reconfigurable pervasive platform containing a dynamically reconfigurable cryptographic coprocessor. As case-study, we consider three ciphering algorithms and we compare the performance of the coprocessor against a full-software implementation. The number of ciphering algorithms can be infinitely extended using a remote server.},

One unintended result of this otherwise sound industry change is the relocation of critical microelectronics manufacturing capabilities from the United States to countries with lower cost capital and operating environments. Trustworthiness and supply assurance for components used in critical military and infrastructure applications are casualties of this migration. Further, while not the focus of this study per se, the U.S. national technological leadership may be increasingly challenged by these changing industry dynamics; this poses long term national economic security concerns.},

This paper illustrates an attack which effectively allows an attacker to ``borrow'' the victim's card for a short period without requiring physical access to the victim's card. As a result the legitimate owner will remain unaware of the attack. We show that our hardware success fully executed a relay attack against an ISO 14443A contactless smart card, up to a distance of 50 m. Simply relaying information between the card and reader over a longer distance does not require the same technical resources from the attacker as hardware tampering or cryptanalysis. This attack is therefore a feasible method for circumventing current security protocols with little effort. Since application-level measures fail to protect against relay attacks, we discuss possible solutions involving characteristics of the physical communication medium.},

This paper shows how an FPGA system based on an Open Source OpenRISC 1200 microprocessor takes advantage of this feature to perform the Secure Download of the firmware and the hardware needed to run an application. In this particular case a Reed-Solomon Encoder and a Cryptographic application were used to demonstrate the viability of the scheme.},

OCB refines a scheme, IAPM, suggested by Charanjit Jutla. Desirable properties of OCB include: the ability to encrypt a bit string of arbitrary length into a ciphertext of minimal length; cheap offset calculations; cheap key setup; a single underlying cryptographic key; no extended-precision addition; a nearly optimal number of block-cipher calls; and no requirement for a random IV. We prove OCB secure, quantifying the adversary's ability to violate the mode's privacy or authenticity in terms of the quality of its block cipher as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) or as a strong PRP, respectively.},

We believe that having all five of these properties makes CWC a powerful tool for use in many performance-critical cryptographic applications. CWC is also the first appropriate solution for some applications; e.g., standardization bodies like the IETF and NIST prefer patent-free modes, and CWC is the first such mode capable of processing data at 10Gbps in hardware, which will be important for future IPsec (and other) network devices. As part of our design, we also introduce a new parallelizable universal hash function optimized for performance in both hardware and software.},

These modes detect encrypted-message forgeries at low cost in performance, power, and implementation, and preserve both message secrecy and integrity in a single pass over the message data. Their performance and security scale directly with those of the underlying block cipher function. We also present the XECB message authentication (XECB-MAC) modes that have all the operational properties of the XOR-MAC modes (e.g., fully parallel and pipelined operation, incremental updates, and out-of-order verification), and have better performance. They are intended for use either stand-alone or with encryption modes that have similar properties (e.g., counter-based XOR encryption).

Major programs such as Future Combat Systems (FCS), Joint Strike Fighter F-35 (JSF), and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) are pushing technological capabilities to their limits. Due to the technology requirements and environments to which they are exposed, these military systems rely on programmable logic (FPGAs) to provide extreme flexibility plus protection from tampering. As FPGAs become an integral part of leading edge architectural design replacing ASICs and ASSPs, the security of the FPGA design and configuration bitstream is of utmost importance. This paper describes two techniques—configuration bitstream encryption and handshaking tokens for securing designers’ intellectual property (IP) within SRAM-based FPGAs.},

To make the Stratix III design security solution more secure and to protect the AES key, many security features have been implemented. The solution has been reviewed by external security consultants during the design phase and improvements have been made based on their feedback.

Furthermore, applications running in redundant systems require fast indication of an SEU in order to minimize the impact upon operation. In many cases, fast correction with minimal impact upon operation is also required.
For systems that require fast recovery from SEUs, this application note describes a pre engineered solution using Virtex-4 devices. It provides single-error correction and double error detection (SECDED) for each unit of device configuration memory. Any changes in the configuration memory are detected by continuous parity checks and can be quickly repaired without loss of FPGA configuration. The SEU controller module can be easily integrated into any standard ISE design project. The solution is completely self-contained, requiring no FPGA I/O pins or external devices, and is capable of monitoring 100 percent of the static CMOS configuration latches (CCLs) in the device.},

  abstract     = {Total power consumption of a board or system is important; each FPGA or ASIC in a system is beginning to be forced to meet a power budget. With this concern and the trend of increasing static power with use of high performance 90 nm FPGAs, Xilinx has put considerable effort into reducing static power in the Virtex-4 FPGAs. To this end, it is important to consider a realistic operating temperature for the FPGAs, which can easily have junction temperature up to and in excess of 85°C. As junction temperature rises, static power rises exponentially, fueling this concern.},

  abstract     = {With the introduction of the Virtex-5 family, Xilinx is once again leading the charge to deliver new
technologies and capabilities to FPGA consumers. The move to 65 nm FPGAs promises to deliver many of the benefits traditionally associated with smaller process geometries: lower cost, higher performance, and greater logic capacity. However, along with these benefits, the 65 nm process node brings with it new challenges. This white paper addresses one of those challenges, power consumption in 65 nm FPGAs. As with the Virtex-4 family, Xilinx has implemented a number of process and architectural innovations in Virtex-5 devices to ensure that static power consumption is minimized and that the dynamic power benefits of moving to a new process node are fully realized.},

Whether boarding a plane, closing the front door, or beginning your next generation circuit design, security has become a significant issue. In our homes, we try to build in the right amount of security to protect ourselves against theft. Security is rapidly becoming a necessity in the electronics industry as well. It is important to understand why security issues have escalated to the forefront in the electronics design field. One reason is the alarming amount of counterfeited goods that are the result of theft. These goods threaten the economy and have a significant effect worldwide in the consumer markets according to the Anti-counterfeiting Coalition. This white paper identifies the top design security threats, explores the basic levels of security, and describes how new, low-cost Spartan-3A, Spartan-3AN, and Spartan-3A DSP FPGAs from Xilinx can help protect your products and profits.},

The security circuit can be a decryption and/or encryption circuit that decrypts and/or encrypts, respectively, a configuration bitstream for the IC. Because of the link between the performance of the security circuit and the physical properties of the IC, the security circuit cannot be used in other ICs. For example, an encrypted bitstream that can be decrypted by the security circuit in a first IC will typically not be decrypted by the same security circuit in a second IC, since the physical properties of the two ICs will typically be different. The evolved circuit can comprise a portion of the security circuit, such as a security key generator, or it can comprise the full security circuit.},
