  abstract     = {PIN entry devices (PEDs) are critical security components 
in EMV smartcard payment systems as they receive a customer's card and PIN. 
Their approval is subject to an extensive suite of evaluation and certification 
procedures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tamper proofing of PEDs is
unsatisfactory, as is the certification process. We have implemented practical
low-cost attacks on two certified, widely-deployed PEDs - the Ingenico 13300
and the Dione Xtreme. By tapping inadequately protected smartcard communications,
an attacker with basic technical skills can expose card details and PINs, 
leaving cardholders open to fraud. We analyze the anti-tampering mechanisms of
the two PEDs and show that, while the specific protection measures mostly work 
as intended, critical vulnerabilities arise because of the poor integration of 
cryptographic, physical and procedural protection. As these vulnerabilities 
illustrate a systematic failure in the design process, we propose a methodology 
for doing it better in the future. These failures also demonstrate a serious 
problem with the Common Criteria. So we discuss the incentive structures of the 
certification process, and show how they can lead to problems of the kind we 
identified. Finally we recommend changes to the Common Criteria framework in 
light of the lessons learned.}
