  abstract     = {Volatile FPGAs, the dominant type of programmable logic 
  devices, are used in space, military, automotive, and consumer electronics 
  applications which require them to operate in a wide range of environments. 
  The continuous growth in both their capability and capacity now requires 
  significant resources to be invested in the designs that are created for 
  them. This has brought increased interest in the security attributes of 
  FPGAs; specifically, how well do they protect the information processed 
  within it, how are designs protected during distribution, and how developers' 
  ownership rights are protected while designs from multiple sources are 
  combined. This survey establishes the foundations for discussing ``FPGA 
  security'', examines a wide range of attacks and defenses along with the 
  current state of industry offerings, and finally, outlines on-going research 
  and latest developments.},
