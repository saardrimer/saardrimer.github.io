  abstract     = {We present an AES cipher implementation that is based on the 
  BlockRAM and DSP units embedded within Xilinx's Virtex-5 FPGAs. An iterative 
  ``basic'' module outputs a 32 bit column of an AES round each clock cycle, 
  with a throughput of 1.76 Gbit/s when processing two 128 bit inputs. This 
  construct is replicated four times for a 128 bit datapath for a full AES round 
  with 6.21 Gbit/s throughput when processing eight inputs. Finally, the ``round'' 
  module is replicated ten times for a fully unrolled design that yields over 
  55 Gbit/s of throughput. The combination and arrangement of the specialized 
  embedded functions available in the FPGA allows us to implement our designs 
  using very few traditional user logic elements such as flip-flops and lookup 
  tables, yet still achieve these high throughputs. The complete source code 
  for these designs is made publicly available for use in further research and 
  for replicating our results. Our contribution ends with a discussion of 
  comparing cipher implementations in the literature, and why these comparisons 
  can be meaningless without a common reporting style, platform, or within the 
  context of a specific constrained application.},
