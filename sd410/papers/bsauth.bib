  abstract     = {Encryption of volatile FPGA bitstreams provides confidentiality 
  to the design but does not ensure its authenticity. This paper motivates the need 
  for adding authentication to the configuration process by providing application 
  examples where this functionality would be useful. An examination of possible 
  solutions is followed by suggesting a practical one in consideration of the FPGA's 
  configuration environment constraints. The solution proposed here involves two 
  symmetric-key encryption cores running in parallel to provide both authentication 
  and confidentiality while sharing resources for efficient implementation.},
