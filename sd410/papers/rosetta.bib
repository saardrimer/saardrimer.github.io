  abstract     = {Results are presented from real-time experiments that evaluated 
  large FPGAs fabricated in different CMOS technologies (0.15 um, 0.13 um and 90 nm) 
  for their sensitivity to radiation-induced single event upsets. These results are 
  compared to circuit simulation (Qcrit) studies, as well as to LANSCE neutron beam 
  results and Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (University of California, Davis) cyclotron 
  proton beam results.},
